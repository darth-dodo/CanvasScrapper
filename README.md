# Canvas Scrapper
A scrapper for the Canvas Instructure platform

## How to use 
I have tried to make this as easy to use, especially for people who dont use python:
1. Download this whole repository as a zip.
2. Install python 2.x or 3x from (here)[https://www.python.org/downloads/]
3. Run "only_run_for_first_time_run_as_admin_installdependancies.bat" to install the dependancies, run it as an administrator. 
4. Run "launch canvas scrapper py2x.bat" or "launch canvas scrapper py3x.bat" acoording to the python version you have 2x or 3x respectively. 

This canvas scrapper downloads only the courses that are marked to show up in the courses menu
